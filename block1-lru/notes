unordered_map, unordered_set

c avl trees:

libc: tsearch (won't work for our specialized case)
boost looks good, but our implementation is too specialized, we will need to roll our own.

we need:

a hash table with key: uint64, value: uint64 (fast fetch, fast update)
an AVL interval tree with key: interval, value: partial sum (find with sum, insert, rebalance)
